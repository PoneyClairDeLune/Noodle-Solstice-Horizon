        <p>This is the best place to show you a little bit of my life, and show you some of the wonderful people I've met and done things with.</p>

            To start, here's Cy, a wonderful scroll loving noodle who's helped me catalogue so much of the world, <br>
            while sneaking in little cute dates and reasons to get good noms! He's a lovely partner, and a wonderful storyteller! <br>
            Cy is very cuddly, and a good kisser, don't tell him I told you that! <br>
            My favorite thing is the look he makes when I blow his mind showing him wonderful things!

            Curio is an adorable adventurous bean who was one of the first noodles I ran into. She was learning she has Draconequus blood in her! <br>
            The two of us quickly met up with another wonderful Draconequus we met, Syren! <br>
            The Three of us were able to adventure across the lands and help each other recover things we lost, grow, and find new purpose! <br>
            She's now happily an apprentice of mine! And a Draconequus of my aspect!

        <p>
            Syren is a lovely and caring Moff-Draconequus who I met early into my adventures! <br>
            Curio found her while trying to buy food supplies for the two of us back when I lost my ability to shape-shift. <br>
            Her keen mind and ability to go invisible helped all of us avoid more than a few magical ambushes! <br>
            She's one of my best friends, and always a blast to be around!
